# ☔ WROVER Humidity Hub & Gateway

The **WROVER Humidity Hub** is a dual-processor IoT gateway that bridges local environmental sensing with a modern web interface. It utilizes an **Arduino Nano** for high-precision DHT11 sensor timing and an **ESP32 WROVER** to host an asynchronous web dashboard, providing real-time humidity tracking and remote hardware control.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a robust **UART-to-Web Gateway**. The system is split into two specialized modules to ensure high reliability and non-blocking performance:

* **Local Node (Nano):** Dedicated to monitoring the DHT11 sensor and driving a 16x2 I2C LCD for local status.
* **Network Gateway (ESP32):** Manages WiFi connectivity, serves a responsive HTML5/CSS3 dashboard, and handles remote API commands.

## ✨ Features

* 📶 **Robust WiFi Management:** Forced "clean-start" sequence with `esp_log` silencing to eliminate association errors.
* 📊 **Real-time Dashboard:** Responsive CSS3 interface with dynamic progress bars and automatic JSON polling every 3s.
* 💬 **Remote LCD Messaging:** Send text from any browser directly to the local 16x2 LCD display.
* 📉 **Historical Tracking:** Automatic Min/Max humidity recording with remote reset capability.
* 🛠️ **Full Serial Logging:** Comprehensive debug prints for both Web-to-Nano and Nano-to-ESP32 communication.

## 🚀 How to Deploy

1. **Wiring:**
* Connect Nano **TX (D1)** to ESP32 **IO27 (RX2)**.
* Connect Nano **RX (D0)** to ESP32 **IO14 (TX2)**.
* Ensure a **Common Ground (GND)** between both boards.


2. **Configuration:** Update `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASS` in the ESP32 code.
3. **Library Dependencies:**
* `DHT sensor library` by Adafruit.
* `LiquidCrystal I2C` by Frank de Brabander.


4. **Access:** Open the ESP32 Serial Monitor to find the local IP, then navigate to it in your browser.
